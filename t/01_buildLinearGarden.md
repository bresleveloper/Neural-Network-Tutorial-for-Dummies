# intro
this project is about to demonstrate how neural networks work.

the 1st page is about just showing a "map", seen in image `img/01_g.png` where the game is that there There is a fruit with spikes and according to the length of the spikes we can know if the fruit is poisonous or not so we use and for the purpose of making the game simple all the non poisonous fruits are deep blue ones in the image and the poisonous of the red ones in the image and as you can see there is a simple linear line and we should use Simple weights To move the line border around so no real network yet

use `img/01_nn.png` to understand what i want to teach

use `img/01_py.png` to understand some code example i want you to implement

# implementation

i want this to be html5/css3/es2025 project.

see `img/01_g_w.png` to learn how the ui should look, with a box of weights on the top right where user can effectively only  play with the line rotation around the 0-0 point, according to the code in `img/01_py.png`

add h1 + h2  headers (think of text) and some description about the text, and show the main NN code in another section, all before the actual result so user with no prior knowledge can learn whats hapening, 

BUILD IT!

output `html/01_rotation_weights.html`
