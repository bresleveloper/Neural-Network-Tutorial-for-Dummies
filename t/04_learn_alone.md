# intro
this project is about to demonstrate how neural networks work.

the 4th page is about letting the NN to learn alone.

## new code
use `img/04/04_py.png` for learning

# instructions
1. do not write from 0, duplicate file `html/03_hidden_layer.html` to `html/04_learn_alone.html` and work on the new file
2. dont change the UI and other functionality other that the code described above, and the text descriptions 
3. be minimalist
4. this is html5/css3/es2025 only project
5. keep my styling
6. remove all control boxes 
7. add output value of cost instead to be constantly updated and add start button
8. think of relevant content for `The Neural Network Structure` section
9. use only sigmoid (ActivationFunction2)
10. dont forget to show all code from image in `The Classification Code` section
