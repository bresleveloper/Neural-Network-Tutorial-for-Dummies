# intro
this project is about to demonstrate how neural networks work.

the 3rd page is about improving on the `html/02_bias.html` "class/lession" by adding hidden layer to the NN.

## new code
use `img/03/03_py_layer.png` and `img/03/03_py_nn.png` as new code to be added to example and actual code. think how to implement it smart and minimal to existing code. do remove what needs to be removed, just try to be minimalist and smart and make it work simple.

those include Layer and NeuralNetwork classes and ActivationFunction, to be used as ActivationFunction`.

use `img/03/03_py_sigmoid.png` for ActivationFunction as ActivationFunction2

## diagram
use `img/03/03_nn_diagram.png` as diagram for the nn

use `img/03/03_d_sigmoid.png` and `img/03/03_d_step.png` for ActivationFunctions images



# instructions
1. do not write from 0, duplicate file `html/02_bias.html` to `html/03_hidden_layer.html` and work on the new file
2. dont change the UI and other functionality other that the code described above, and the text descriptions 
3. be minimalist
4. this is html5/css3/es2025 only project
5. keep my styling
6. change `The Neural Network Structure` section of `class="nn-visual"` content to the diagram of nn
7. add a section to show the difference about ActivationFunction 1 or 2 to learn about the curving, use images mentioned above



# implementation
1. refactor the js code
2. add 2 control boxes for new sets of weights and biases
3. add a toggle to choose ActivationFunction 1 or 2 to learn about the curving, as a control box between original boxes and new boxes
