# intro
this project is about to demonstrate how neural networks work.

the 2nd page is about improving on the `html/01_rotation_weights.html` "class/lession" by adding bias to the NN.

use `img/02/02_bias_py.png` the new code to be added to example and actual code

use `img/02/02_newBox.png` how to add the new control box


# instructions
1. do not write from 0, duplicate file `html/01_rotation_weights.html` to `html/01_bias.html` and work on the new file
2. do no change anything, just add the bias functionality
3. be minimalist
4. this is html5/css3/es2025 only project
5. keep my styling

# implementation
1. add the bias to js code 
2. add control box to control bias values
3. add the bias to code section and highlight it
